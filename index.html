          <h2>  CHIDIYA </h2>
          <p>Hello chidiya we both met first time in college (malawa institude of technology) and  we talked for the
            first time like everyone does then one day we sat together in the class which was ED class ,that
            moment when the Chidiya asked me if i can sit ,that was our first time meeting when we were sitting together
            on a bench and that was also our most intresting period because at that time we both used to sit together only
            for one period hence our most favorite class had become ED and then graduaally our talks increased and we start
             living together  throughout the college time and we did not realize when our friendship turned into love .We
             start getting along very well ,we both started understanding each other ,after that one day we both i dated
             someone else outside the college that day and my friend,his girlfriend and the chidiya were with me ,our
             first date date was on the plane which was very good and memorable ,after that we also stayed together on the bunk
             of the college and we created a lot of memories then we both planned a date which was at rajanal pond which was
             on 15th januaryand we consider that day as our<font color ="red" size ="5"> anniversary</font>
